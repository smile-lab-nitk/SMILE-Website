### Welcome to the Stochastic Modeling, Imaging and LEarning (SMILE) Lab

Welcome to the Stochastic Modeling, Imaging and LEarning (SMILE) Lab at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal. We are a part of the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering.  
In Stochastic Modeling, Imaging, and LEarning (SMILE) Lab, we are interested in developing and optimizing novel Deep learning and speech signal processing algorithms to solve real-world problems. Majority of our ongoing research projects can be categorized into one of the following two areas:

1. *Image processing and pattern recognition*
2. *Speech signal processing*
